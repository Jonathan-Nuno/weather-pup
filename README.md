# 🐶 WeatherPup — Paw-fect Forecasts for Your Pup

Welcome to **WeatherPup**, a playful weather app that helps you check the **current conditions** and **hour-by-hour forecast for today**, all while dressing up a pup for the weather outside 🐾

Depending on what Mother Nature is up to, your pup will swap outfits — raincoat, cozy layers, or sunshine-ready gear — so you always know what kind of day it is at a glance.
